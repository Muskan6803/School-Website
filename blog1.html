        <h1 style="text-align: center;">“Ways to build a resume when you have zero experience”</h1><br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            Ms. Anchal Malhotra, Assistant Professor, Guru Nanak Khalsa Institute of Technology and Management Technical
            Campus, Yamuna Nagar-Haryana (India).
            How do you write a resume with no experience?<br>

            I need a job to get experience, but I need experience to get a job. Either way, you need a resume, and what
            you don't need is to panic. Just because you don't have existing skills that are relevant to the job or
            experience in a traditional work setting doesn't mean you can't craft a convincing first job resume.<br>

            Here are four simple tactics to get you started on finding valuable experience, connecting with mentors, and
            getting employed by graduation.<br>

            “How am I supposed to get a job when I don’t have any experience?”<br>

            Experience is like the answer to a frustrating riddle. Every job wants you to already have it—you need
            experience to get in the door, but since you don’t have any experience, there’s seemingly no way for you to
            get it in the first place.<br>

            Luckily, there are ways to get job experience when you don’t have any, as well as some workarounds to help
            you get your foot in the door.<br>

            If you’re a student writing a resume with no experience, start doing these three things NOW. Before you know
            it, you’ll have some exciting content to include and the connections to actually send it out.<br><br>

            1. Volunteer<br>
            Take a look at the student union at your school or even reach out to your teachers; you never know what type
            of opportunities you may find, employers actually want to see if you’re committed to do things out of your
            routine class. If you’re serious about pursuing a career in a given industry, then you should seek out
            events happening in that industry. Reach out to see if you can help in any way. You’ll get to attend a
            pricey event for free and also meet people in your industry while gaining something to add to your resume.
            Employers want to see that you’re committed to things outside of just going to class. It shows dedication,
            plus great time-management skills.<br><br>

            2. Decide on a resume format<br>
            There are a few dominant resume templates in use today: chronological, functional, and hybrid, which is a
            combination of the two. A chronological resume format lists a candidate's work experience in
            reverse-chronological order. A functional resume format focuses on highlighting the candidate's skills and
            achievements, rather than work experience. While the functional resume format can be an attractive option
            for job seekers with little experience, most employers prefer a chronological or hybrid resume format.
            Whatever resume format you decide to use, be sure that your format remains consistent throughout the job
            resume.<br><br>

            3. Internships, internships, internships<br>
            Paid and unpaid college internships are one of the best weapons you have against "experience required." Not
            only do they give you some real-world work experience, they also allow you to network and make connections
            that can put you in a job later. When applying for a job without experience, be sure to list any internships
            you completed. If you haven't had one, consider applying as a step before an entry-level job.<br><br>

            4. Start using Social Media for right work<br>
            Stop using your social media to post that photo of you and your friends that you look “oh so cute” in and
            start using it to help get yourself ahead and make connections that can lead to work. First off, take some
            time to do a social media sweep and make sure there’s nothing on there you wouldn’t want an employer to see.<br><br>

            Connect with them and send them a personal message on why you want to connect with them.<br>

            Next, update your LinkedIn profile to be a true reflection of you, and start utilizing that search bar.
            Search people in your city and within your industry. Connect with them and send them a personal message on
            why you want to connect with them. Once you connect, invite them to coffee or an informational interview.<br>

            Finding influential people in your industry on social media, then following and engaging with them is a much
            more informal way of building relationships. However, it’s a great way for possible mentors and employers to
            see just how passionate you are about your industry.<br><br>

            5. Take stock of your achievements and activities<br>
            Make a list of absolutely everything you've done that might be useful on a resume. From this list, you'll
            then need to narrow down what to actually include on your resume. Different things might be relevant to
            different jobs you apply for, so keep a full list and pick the most relevant things from it to include on
            your resume when you send it out.<br><br>

            You’re probably thinking, “But isn’t going to college enough?” and the answer is a big no. You can choose to
            postpone building your resume and network until the day you walk across that stage, but how are you going to
            compete with all the students that spent those four years doing something more?<br></p>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Coping Mechanism to deal with Exam Stress</h1><br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        Ms. Anchal Malhotra, Assistant Professor, Guru Nanak Khalsa Institute of Technology and Management Technical
        Campus, Yamuna Nagar-Haryana (India).<br>
        Some students are just exam people – they have no trouble getting their heads down to revise and seem to fly
        through assessment periods without batting an eyelid. But for others exams can be incredibly stressful.<br>

        That exam stress happens to all of us. According to The Globe and Mail, 90% of Canadian university students feel
        stressed and/or overwhelmed during exam periods.<br>

        Post-secondary is stressful. Peak stress times are during midterms and exams. Shocker, right? Many students face
        multiple exams in a short amount of days. When the workload piles up, it creates enormous amounts of stress.
        When stress occurs, it can be really hard to escape. That can lead to panic and/or anxiety attacks. Students
        should feel calm, cool, and collected. Of course, that’s easier said than done, eh?<br>

        So, how can we really cope with exam anxiety?<br>

        There’s no right way to deal with stress. Everyone deals with stress in their own way. Everyone is different and
        will find mechanisms that work for them over others. By starting early, staying organized, and taking breaks,
        you will realize that stress CAN be controlled.<br><br>

        1. Take regular breaks and schedule in fun things to look forward to<br>
        Even the most intense exam timetables will allow a little time for a study break. This can include 20-minute
        breaks during your revision day, and longer activities that you can look forward to. Go out for dinner with
        friends, go to the cinema, attend a gig, anything that you like doing in your spare time that will take your
        mind off exams. Spending a little time away from the books will leave you feeling more refreshed and relaxed the
        next time you revise<br><br>

        2. Prepare Yourself, DON’T Compare Yourself<br>
        We all do it. Yet, comparing yourself to your peers will stress you out even more. Psychology Today states that
        college mental health experts have found a strong correlation between student stress and social comparison. Your
        friend might know pretty much everything after a day or two of studying while you need more time to absorb the
        material. Do not stress! If you focus too much on what other people know, you won’t have time to learn the
        information yourself. That will stress you out even more. Study how you need to study to be successful!<br><br>

        3. Tune out the Exam Anxiety<br>
        This is a personal favourite. Music has always been a great way for me to de-stress and it can work for you too!
        Whether you are taking a break to listen or listening while you work, both are equally beneficial. Psych Central
        states that listening to music offers a tremendous amount of relaxing effects on our minds and bodies. It slows
        our heart rate, lowers blood pressure and decreases levels of stress hormones. Classical music is one of the
        best genres to listen to while studying (lyrics can sometimes be distracting)<br><br>

        Don’t cry your eyes out! Find ways to deal with stress and conquer your exams to the best of your abilities. Try
        any of these strategies, or try them all! Something will stick. Now that you have a sense of how to cope with
        your stress, start studying earlier, develop a plan, and conquer your goals.</p>
