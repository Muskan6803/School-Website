                            like mobile phones – in case of any delays or unforeseen events, a message gets flashed to
                            the school, which in turn informs the parents, and initiates action for backup
                            transportation measures, if required. Each bus has a driver, conductor and a security guard,
                            for complete safety and security of the children. The routes and timings of the entire fleet
                            of buses are monitored by a well trained staff.</p>
